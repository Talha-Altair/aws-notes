Cloud Formation:

Info:


** 

AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to model a collection of related AWS and third-party
resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them throughout their lifecycles, 
by treating infrastructure as code. 

**

A CloudFormation template describes your desired resources and
their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack.


**
You can use a template to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit,
as often as you need to, instead of managing resources individually.

**
You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions.

**
Automate best practices
With CloudFormation, you can apply DevOps and GitOps best practices using widely adopted processes

**
starting with a git repository and deploying through a CI/CD pipeline. 

**
You can also simplify auditing changes and trigger automated deployments with pipeline integrations such as
GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline.

**
Scale your infrastructure worldwide
Manage resource scaling by sharing CloudFormation templates to be used across your organization,
to meet safety, compliance, and configuration standards across all AWS accounts and regions.

**
Templates and parameters enable easy scaling so you can share best practices and company policies. 

**
Additionally, CloudFormation StackSets enables you to create, update,
or delete stacks across multiple AWS accounts and Regions, with a single operation.

**
Integrate with other AWS services
To further automate resource management across your organization, you can integrate CloudFormation with other AWS services, including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control, AWS Config for compliance, 
and AWS Service Catalog for turnkey application distribution and additional governance controls

**
Integrations with CodePipeline and other builder tools let you implement the latest
DevOps best practices and improve automation, testing, and controls.

**
Manage third-party and private resources
Model, provision, and manage third-party application resources (such as monitoring, team productivity,
incident management, CI/CD, and version control applications) alongside your AWS resources


**

Use the open source CloudFormation CLI to build your own CloudFormation resource providers
–native AWS types published as open source.


**

Extend CloudFormation with the community
The AWS CloudFormation GitHub organization 
offers open source projects that extend CloudFormation’s capabilities. 


**
The CloudFormation Registry and CloudFormation CLI let you define and create resource
providers to automate the creation of resources safely and systematically. 


**
Using CloudFormation GitHub projects, you can do things like check CloudFormation templates for
policy compliance (using cfn-guard), or validate use of best practices (using cfn-lint).
